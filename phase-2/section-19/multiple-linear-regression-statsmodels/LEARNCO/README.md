# Multiple Linear Regression in Statsmodels - Lab

## Introduction
In this lab, you'll practice fitting a multiple linear regression model on the Ames Housing dataset!

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Determine if it is necessary to perform normalization/standardization for a specific model or set of data
* Use standardization/normalization on features of a dataset
* Identify if it is necessary to perform log transformations on a set of features
* Perform log transformations on different features of a dataset
* Use statsmodels to fit a multiple linear regression model
* Evaluate a linear regression model by using statistical performance metrics pertaining to overall model and specific parameters


## The Ames Housing Data

Using the specified continuous and categorical features, preprocess your data to prepare for modeling:
* Split off and one hot encode the categorical features of interest
* Log and scale the selected continuous features


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

ames = pd.read_csv('ames.csv')

continuous = ['LotArea', '1stFlrSF', 'GrLivArea', 'SalePrice']
categoricals = ['BldgType', 'KitchenQual', 'SaleType', 'MSZoning', 'Street', 'Neighborhood']

```

## Continuous Features


```python
# Log transform and normalize
```

## Categorical Features


```python
# One hot encode categoricals
```

## Combine Categorical and Continuous Features


```python
# combine features into a single dataframe called preprocessed
```

## Run a linear model with SalePrice as the target variable in statsmodels


```python
# Your code here
```

## Run the same model in scikit-learn


```python
# Your code here - Check that the coefficients and intercept are the same as those from Statsmodels
```

## Predict the house price given the following characteristics (before manipulation!!)

Make sure to transform your variables as needed!

- LotArea: 14977
- 1stFlrSF: 1976
- GrLivArea: 1976
- BldgType: 1Fam
- KitchenQual: Gd
- SaleType: New
- MSZoning: RL
- Street: Pave
- Neighborhood: NridgHt

## Summary
Congratulations! You pre-processed the Ames Housing data using scaling and standardization. You also fitted your first multiple linear regression model on the Ames Housing data using statsmodels and scikit-learn!
